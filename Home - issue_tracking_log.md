## Core System Issues

### ‚úÖ Holding Backspace Key Behavior
**Issue**: Holding backspace doesn't continually delete characters in applications like Obsidian  
**Resolution**: Fixed after system restart following T2 driver installations  
**Root Cause**: Incomplete keyboard driver initialization  
**Action Required**: None - resolves automatically after proper T2 setup

### ‚úÖ WiFi Connectivity  
**Issue**: WiFi interface (wlan0) doesn't come up automatically after fresh installation  
**Resolution**: Manual interface activation required: `sudo ip link set wlan0 up`  
**Root Cause**: T2-specific Broadcom WiFi drivers require manual interface initialization  
**Documentation**: [[wifi_runbook]]
**Permanent Fix**: Systemd service created for automatic interface activation on boot

### ‚úÖ Bluetooth Basic Functionality
**Issue**: Bluetooth service not working initially  
**Resolution**: Fixed after system restart  
**Root Cause**: Service initialization timing with T2 drivers  
**Action Required**: None after initial setup [[bluetooth_testing]]

### ‚úÖ Bluetooth Audio Quality  
**Issue**: Audio crackling and stuttering when initially connecting Bluetooth devices  
**Resolution**: Enable RTKit daemon for proper PipeWire priority management  
**Root Cause**: PipeWire audio processes start at normal priority before RTKit elevates them  
**Documentation**: [[bluetooth_audio_runbook]]
**Technical Details**: PipeWire-pulse runs at normal priority causing buffer underruns until RTKit grants real-time priority

### ‚úÖ Display Brightness Control
**Issue**: Brightness function keys work but don't affect actual screen brightness  
**Resolution**: Target correct backlight device (`acpi_video0`) in brightness controls  
**Root Cause**: Multiple backlight devices available, default selection incorrect  
**Documentation**: 
**Implementation**: Modified Hyprland keybindings to use `brightnessctl -d acpi_video0`

### ‚úÖ Keyboard and Trackpad Hardware
**Issue**: Keyboard and trackpad non-functional after fresh installation  
**Resolution**: Install T2-specific drivers (linux-t2, apple-bce, t2fanrd) and restart system  
**Root Cause**: T2 security chip requires specialized drivers for input device communication  
**Documentation**:¬†[[keyboard_trackpad_runbook]]
**Implementation**: apple-bce module provides Bridge Control Engine interface for T2 input devices
### ‚úÖ Keyboard Backlight Control
**Issue**: Keyboard backlight function keys non-functional  
**Resolution**: Configure brightnessctl for `apple::kbd_backlight` device  
**Root Cause**: T2-specific keyboard backlight device path  
**Documentation**: [[display_brightness_runbook]]
**Implementation**: Custom key bindings in Hyprland configuration

### ‚úÖ Clamshell Mode (Laptop Lid Behavior)
**Issue**: No clamshell mode functionality - closing lid with external monitor doesn't work properly  
**Resolution**: Install and configure hyprdock with acpid for hardware lid event detection  
**Root Cause**: No built-in clamshell mode support in Hyprland  
**Documentation**: [[clamshell_mode_runbook]]
**Technical Implementation**: 
  - acpid for lid event detection
  - hyprdock daemon for monitor management  
  - systemd-logind lid switch handling disabled

### ‚úÖ Xbox Controller Bluetooth Pairing
**Issue**: Xbox controller fails to pair using standard Bluetooth pairing procedures  
**Resolution**: Use specific pairing sequence: trust ‚Üí connect ‚Üí pair  
**Root Cause**: T2 Bluetooth stack requires non-standard pairing order  
**Documentation**: [[xbox_controller_runbook]]
**Critical Detail**: Standard pair ‚Üí connect sequence fails; trust-first sequence succeeds

### ‚úÖ External Monitor Sleep/Wake Reconnection

**Issue**: External monitors fail to reconnect or display properly after system wakes from sleep/suspend  
**Resolution**: systemd-sleep script automatically runs DPMS reset after resume: `hyprctl dispatch dpms on`  
**Root Cause**: Hyprland display power management state becomes desynchronized after suspend/resume cycle  
**Documentation**: [[external_monitor_sleep_runbook]]
**Permanent Fix**: `/usr/lib/systemd/system-sleep/99-monitor-wake.sh` script handles automatic reconnection  
**Fallback Method**: Manual VT switching (Ctrl+Alt+F3 ‚Üí Ctrl+Alt+F1) forces display reinitialization

### ‚úÖ Node.js Development Environment Setup

**Issue**: Need to develop Node.js and React applications on Omarchy  
**Resolution**: Install Node.js, npm, and configure VS Code with essential extensions  
**Root Cause**: Fresh system lacks development tooling  
**Guide**: [[nodejs_runbook]]
**Action Required**: Run installation commands and configure VS Code settings

---

## Hardware-Specific Limitations

### üìã Sony WH-1000XM5 Hardware Volume Controls
**Issue**: Volume controls on Sony headphones don't work with PipeWire  
**Resolution**: User chose not to fix - documented limitation  
**Root Cause**: Sony's volume control protocol conflicts with PipeWire volume management  
**Workaround**: Use software volume controls instead of hardware buttons  
**Impact**: Low - software volume control works normally

### üîÑ External Monitor Connection After Sleep
**Issue**: When laptop goes to sleep, external monitor sometimes doesn't reconnect  
**Status**: Transient issue - occurs intermittently  
**Temporary Workaround**: Manual monitor detection via `hyprctl dispatch dpms off/on`  
**Root Cause**: Power management timing issues with external display detection  
**Frequency**: Occasional - not consistent enough for dedicated debugging effort

## Development Experience Notes

**Quote from User**: *"I really feel 12 again tinkering with Linux!"*

This captures the essential experience - while T2 MacBooks require additional configuration compared to standard PC hardware, the process is methodical and the solutions are stable once implemented. Each issue has a clear technical cause and reproducible solution.

### Lessons Learned
1. **T2 Driver Dependencies**: Many issues resolve after proper T2-specific package installation
2. **Service Timing**: Several issues are caused by service initialization timing rather than fundamental incompatibility
3. **Hardware Abstraction**: T2 chip creates unique device paths and behaviors requiring specific configuration
4. **Community Resources**: T2 Linux community has developed robust solutions for all major compatibility issues

### Recommendations for Future Installers
1. **Follow T2 Linux Installation Guide**: Use official T2 ISO and installation procedures
2. **Install T2 Packages First**: Complete T2-specific package installation before troubleshooting individual issues  
3. **Systematic Approach**: Address issues in order of system impact (network, audio, display, peripherals)
4. **Documentation**: Keep detailed notes - T2 hardware quirks can be device-specific
